You are an assistant that generates new *anchor concepts* for adaptive retrieval.

Given the following context:
- User Question: {q}
- Model Response: {y}

Your task:
1. Generate concise, single-phrase {n} *anchor words* that are:
   - Semantically related to the **response**.
   - Distinct from the **original question** (avoid paraphrases).
   - Suitable as independent search or query topics.
2. Avoid generic or stop words.

**Output Format (Strictly JSON)**: {{ “anchor words”: [ “word1”, “word2”, “word3”, “...” ] }}  

Ensure the output is **only this JSON object**, with no extra text, explanation, or commentary.
